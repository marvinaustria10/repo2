**Objective:** 
Introduce students to the fundamental concepts of version control using Git and collaborative development with GitHub.

**Materials:**
- Computers with Git and GitHub accounts
- Command-line interface
- Text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) 


**Activity Steps:** 

**Step 1: Set Up Git and GitHub**
1. Check if Git is installed: `git --version`
2. If not installed, install https://git-scm.com/download/win
 
3. Create a Github account. 
 


**Step 2: Git Basics**
1. Create a new directory: `mkdir git-intro`
2. Move into the directory: `cd git-intro`
3. Initialize a Git repository: `git init` 
4. Create a new text file: `touch README.md`  
5. Add content to README.md: "Introduction to Git and GitHub." 
6. Stage the file: `git add README.md`
7. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
 
 

**Step 3: Collaborative Development on GitHub**
1.	Create a new repository on GitHub (without initializing a README).
 
2. Link the local repository to the remote repository: `git remote add origin <repository_url>`
3. Push the initial commit to GitHub: `git push -u origin master`
 
 


**Step 4: Working with Branches**
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-branch`
2. Open README.md and add more content.
3. Stage and commit the changes on the branch.
4. Push the branch to GitHub: `git push origin feature-branch`
 

**Step 5: Pull Requests on GitHub**
1. On GitHub, create a pull request for the `feature-branch` to be merged into `master`.
2. Review the pull request, add comments if necessary.
 
 
2.	Merge the pull request.
 
3.	Fetch the changes to the local repository: `git pull origin master`
 

**Step 6: Clone and Collaborate**
1.	Choose a partner and have one of you create a new repository on GitHub.
 ¬¬
2. The other person clones the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
3. Collaborate by creating branches, making changes, and creating pull requests.

Laboratory Activity: Introduction to Git and GitHub

What is the purpose of a pull request on GitHub, and how does it facilitate collaborative development?
















Explain the difference between a local Git repository and a remote repository on GitHub. How do they interact?













Walk through the process of creating a new branch, making changes on that branch, and then merging those changes back into the main branch using Git and GitHub.
